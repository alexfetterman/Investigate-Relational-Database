## Exploration of DVD rental data from PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL's website provides a sample database of DVD rentals. Here I've compiled queries of varying complexity as a way to document the work done with the database and to keep track of my growth and skills in SQL.

#### Structure
The clauses and tools used in each query are listed as the title, followed by a brief description of what the query does and the query itself (they do not run). Queries 1-3 are answers to challenges provided by Udaicty. I wrote queries 4-7 to answer specific questions about the database, which can be found under the clauses and tools used. These tasks were completed as part of the requirements for Udacity's Programming for Data Science Nanodegree.

#### Notice
This code does not run in the notebook, but an entity relationship diagram (ERD) exists in the repository.

#### Technologies
Jupyter Notebook, PostgreSQL, Tableau
